# Important Notice ⚠️
## Version 7.0.0 Notice:
v7.0.0 of this repository was based on Windows App SDK (WASDK) v1.6.2, which has been unlisted by Microsoft due to critical bugs affecting Windows 10 users. To ensure stability, we have also unlisted v7.0.0 from nuget.

## Version 7.1.0 Announcement:
v7.1.0 will be released soon, based on the upcoming WASDK v1.6.3 release from Microsoft, containing the necessary fixes.

# Last Release:
Please note that v7.1.0 will be the final release for this repository, as we are transitioning to our new and improved repository (DevWinUI).

Thank you for your patience and support as we ensure a stable and reliable experience for our users. Stay tuned for the v7.1.0 release!

## 🚀 Repository Retired! 🚀
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository has been retired and is no longer actively maintained. We’ve rebranded and launched a new and improved repository to better serve your needs! 🎉

## Why the Change?
Over time, we’ve gained valuable experience and insights that allowed us to create a more efficient, faster, and feature-rich solution. The new repository reflects our commitment to providing the best possible experience for our users.
After careful consideration, we realized that rebranding and starting fresh would allow us to address some key challenges and provide a better experience:

- *Streamlined Structure:* In the new repository, components such as Components/LandingPages/Win2D have been merged into a unified Controls section. This consolidation simplifies usage and ensures better integration.
- *Naming Challenges:* The name "WinUICommunity" was difficult to spell, too long, and lacked clarity. It was also ambiguous, often confused with other projects like the Community Toolkit.
- *Clarity and Vision:* The rebrand reflects a clear and focused vision, ensuring the repository name and purpose are meaningful and easy to understand.
- *Breaking Changes:* To innovate and improve, we’ve introduced some breaking changes in the new repository.
- *Improved Experience:* Based on our growing experience, the new repository is designed to be faster, AOT Support, more reliable, and feature-rich.
